<h3>Integrated Memory Controller</h3>

<p>All current microprocessors have <em>intergrated memory controller</em> (IMC)</p>

<p>moved from the moterhboard chip intO teh CPU To optimize the flow of information into and out from the CPU, and <em>(IMC)</em> enables faster control</p>
<p>over the things like the large <em>L3 cache</em> shared among multiple cores.</p>

<p>Just like in so many other areas of computing manufactureres implement a variety of IMC's in their CPU's in practice this means that diffrent CPU's handle diffrent types and capacities of RAM I'll save the details on those RAM veriations for chapter 4 for now add "diffrent RAM support" to your list of things to look at when making a cpu reccomendation for a client.</p>
